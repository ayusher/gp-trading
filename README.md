Trading Stocks using Genetic Programming

## Getting started
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 train2.py`

## File Documentation
`tree_trading.py`: defines the nodes and their function sets

`genetic_trader.py`: defines the backtesting class that evaluates each function tree

`train.py`: older training file that does not have the ability to train on multiple assets

## Future works
`instruction_set.py`: using human readable instructions to specify which terminal nodes to use
